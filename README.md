#### Corners_Regression_Model

Football-data.com dataset (UK and European leagues) was pre-processed with features added/transformed to include match percentages, goal expectations team home & away corner seasonal running averages etc. Visualizations of the distributions and correlations of these features were analysed and relevent features selected. Regression model train/test splits were then performed to best fit the data and a final predictive model produced.
